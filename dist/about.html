            the age of 17, I found out about programming. My "Hello, World!"
            program was in C# thanks to some videos on Youtube. When I graduated
            high-school I was still that sporty guy but I also wanted to
            continue with my second love, technology. I went to New Bulgarian
            University in 2018 and started studying computer science although I
            wasn't sure what to expect and if it will suit me. From the
            beginning, teachers started talking about algorithms and math but I
            wasn't into that at all. Thereafter, I realized that without these
            two things I won't become a good programmer. At the end of first
            semester, I found out that there is something called Frontend and I
            liked it. That's where I decided that I want to continue to develop
            in that area. But because of the lack of information about Frontend
            at university, I actually study it all by myself.
